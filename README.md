My 43789th (yes, I exaggerate) attempt to attack the Million Random Digits Challenge.
It is called "10" due to the fact that it is the 10th attempt to attack it using Microsoft C (Visual C++ 6.0 compiler).

## Purpose
Absolutely none. It is very old, so I'll just leave it here. I found it on an old harddrive.

I doubt anybody still have an old copy of Visual C++ lying around, so I can't guarantee that it will actually compile.

### The Challenge
The challenge is about trying to compress a million random digits. Price will be 100 USD and eternal fame and possibly job offers from top-tier companies in 'the valley'.
